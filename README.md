# Vuelation Toolkit

A collection of [webpack](https://webpack.github.io) loaders and
[Vue.js](http://vuejs.org) components used by Codelation.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install vuelation-toolkit --save-dev
```

## Why?

The tools we use when building Vue.js apps are changing rapidly as we learn more and better take advantage
of them, so this package ensures the tools we use remain consistent and up-to-date across applications.
